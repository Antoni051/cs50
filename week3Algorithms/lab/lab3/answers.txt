sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Much faster than on reversed50k and random50k so must be bubble O(n)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Much much faster than others in random and reversed

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: 

reversed50k
sort 1 = 9.63 secs 
sort 2 = 0.47secs 
sort3 = 4secs 

random50k
sort 1 = 8s
sort 2 = 0.47s
sort 3 = 4secs 

sorted50k
sort 1 = 0.851s
sort 2 = 0.7s
sort 3 = 4.19s
